## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).



## WHAT DO DO
Tetris JFX

In case you have never played tetris before, each shape appeared will be randomized with a distinct color.
Once you have your shape, you can use the arrow keys to control where you want to place it.
The up arrow turns the shape clockwise, and the down arrow drags the shape down faster. 
Once a shape hits the top  of the screen, you lose. 
Repeat and have fun!
